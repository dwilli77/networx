              <h5 class="description">
                Building relationships across social class lines is a complex
                process with many rewards and pitfalls. Best practices gleaned
                from other national initiatives, asset-based community
                development, strength-based assessment, a historical movement
                resulting in significant change, and other research-based
                material informed the development of the NETworX model. NETworX
                is based on the Methodist movement which French Theologian
                Halevy believed provided a “ladder of opportunity” for those
                experiencing poverty. Weekly classes, accountability, and
                relationship building were the core of the Methodist movement
                and are at the core of the NETworX initiative.

              <h2 class="title">Origins of NETworX</h2>
              <h5 class="description">
                NETworX began in North Carolina in 2015 rooted in best practices
                and wisdom gained from work in other similar initiatives. Others
                states that had also been engaged in anti-poverty work were
                interested in beginning something with a more relational core.
                After prayers for discernment and compassionate disagreement a
                meeting with several potential stakeholders was held in Atlanta,
                and the result was the birth of the NETworX initiative. NETworX
                continues to evolve through the feedback and wisdom of those in
                NETworX communities providing guidance on every aspect of the
                initiative.

              <h2 class="title">Model and Strategy</h2>
              <h5 class="description">
                At the model's core are weekly meetings that include shared
                meals, time for relationship-building and mutual accountability,
                goal setting, and celebration.  Childcare and transportation,
                frequent barriers to regular participation, are provided as
                needed without cost.  Education around the topics of self-
                awareness, racial equity, addiction in all of its forms, aspects
                of privilege, holistic poverty, social capital, the role of
                personal and community trauma, and community transformation form
                the topical base of the training classes.

              <h5 class="description">
                Reciprocal relationships, built over a period, of time, are
                central and are built through the shared cohort experience and
                shared vulnerability.  Participants support one another as they
                develop their individual strengths, capacities, and potential.
                Finally, because the level of transformation desired takes place
                over time, participants are asked to dedicate 18-36 months to
                training and relationship building.

              <h5 class="description">
                A NETworX Intentional Community is created through cohorts that
                mirror the community at large. They should be diverse and
                inclusive of participants from various racial, economic, and
                social backgrounds invested in personal and community
                transformation through connection and igniting human
                transformation.

                interest in changing the mindset of poverty, having capacity for
                personal change, and committing to engaging openly with others,
                especially during the rough spots, toward a goal of personal and
                community well-being. For this reason participants share common
                criteria including (1) having a stable residence, (2) not

                non-violent problem solving and (4) consistency/stability in

                    performs in a three-piece combo and as a member of his local
                    church praise band. In the 1970’s, he performed as a

                    phrase that elicits a groan from his son and wife, as he
                    works to build on what someone has said, often far beyond
                    where they have any interest in going. He recently started a
                    men’s book club called Spirited Civil Discourse, where folks
                    come together at a local restaurant to discuss current

                    the Smedley kitchen. Carl Jung had this carved over the
