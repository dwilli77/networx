                Building relationships across social class lines is a complex
                process with many rewards and pitfalls. Best practices gleaned
                from other national initiatives, asset-based community
                development, strength-based assessment, a historical movement
                resulting in significant change, and other research-based
                material informed the development of the NETworX model.

              <h5 class="description">
                At the model's core are weekly meetings that include shared
                meals, time for relationship-building and mutual accountability,
                goal setting, and celebration.  Childcare and transportation,
                frequent barriers to regular participation, are provided as
                needed without cost.  Education around the topics of self-
                awareness, racial equity, addiction in all of its forms, aspects
                of privilege, holistic poverty, social capital, the role of
                personal and community trauma, and community transformation form
                the topical base of the training classes.

              <h5 class="description">
                Reciprocal relationships, built over a period, of time, are
                central and are built through the shared cohort experience and
                shared vulnerability.  Participants support one another as they
                develop their individual strengths, capacities, and potential.
                Finally, because the level of transformation desired takes place
                over time, participants are asked to dedicate 18-36 months to
                training and relationship building.

                A NETworX Intentional Community is created through cohorts that
                mirror the community at large. They should be diverse and

                social backgrounds invested in personal and community
                transformation through connection and igniting human potential.

                  <p class="card-description">
                    Tom is from the Wilmington/ Wrightsville Beach area of NC,
                    though he has spent most of his adult life elsewhere,
                    including the mid-Atlantic, the mid-West, and now the West.
                    He is an Episcopal priest, has served several congregations,
                    and has been a deputy to the General Convention of the
                    Episcopal Church three times, including service on the
                    legislative committee on Social and Urban Affairs.

                  <p class="card-description">
                    He was first exposed to a model of addressing poverty by
                    bringing people together across class lines and building
                    mutually supportive relationships while living in Muncie,
                    IN. The congregation he served there provided office and
                    program space for an organization that had successfully
                    implemented such a model locally and had been on the
                    forefront of it nationally. Having the opportunity to run a
                    comparable organization and program in Carson City has been
                    both enlightening and enriching. He has grown and continue
                    to grow in amazing ways.

                  <p class="card-description">
                    A native of West Virginia, Lee loves being outside, walking,
                    hiking or bicycling. And, he loves singing too. He currently
                    performs in a three-piece combo and as a member of his local
                    church praise band. In the 1970’s, he performed as a
                    strolling musician at Colonial Williamsburg, and has
                    recorded a CD of his own original music.

                    An insufferable extrovert, Lee loves engaging others in
                    conversations about possibilities. “You could even…..” is a
                    phrase that elicits a groan from his son and wife, as he
                    works to build on what someone has said, often far beyond
                    where they have any interest in going. He recently started a
                    men’s book club called Spirited Civil Discourse, where folks
                    come together at a local restaurant to discuss current
                    issues and ofttimes controversial books.

                  <p class="card-description">
                    Lee’s life verse is Eph 2:10. The Latin phrase: VOVATUS
                    ATQUE NON VOCATUS DUES ADERIT is prominently displayed in
                    the Smedley kitchen. Carl Jung had this carved over the
                    front door of his house. It means: “Bidden or not bidden,
                    God is Present”
